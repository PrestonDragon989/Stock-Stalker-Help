            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>Here is where you can find the newest versions of the app. You can find distrubitions in many different forms as well. This includes Windows, Windows in a format that Windows likes, & even Linux. To get started, follow <a href="start.html">our guide</a>, but to update your software, simply delete the version you have now, and install the new one! Nothing is saved directly in the app, so everything will cary over.</p>

                <h2>Legacy Versions</h2>
                <p>Legacy editions are editions that are no longer supported, and are outdated. When a new update comes out, and it replaces the current installs & versions, but you like it less, you can (most likely) still use an older version instead. Some that are outdated may still work, and some work. It is best practice to come check and see if a new version exists, but not if you don't want.</p>
                <p>The reason I have included legacy editions in the installs, is to just let the user choose whatever they want. After all, why should I force everyone to use a version they don't like? Better to let them just use what version they like the best. Not much harm in that.</p>
                <p><i>As of 6/12/24, there is no older editions.</i></p>
