        <h2 class="mh">Getting Started with Stalker</h2>
        <p class="mp">Stalker is an app that doesn't require administrator privileges, and it isn't that big either. It also doesn't require a lot of power to run. It's also fairly easy to set up, and start using right away! There are some restrictions though. You need at least an okay internet connection to use it, and OS that can run a version of it (Something like windows or linux), and a place where you can run the file from. Thats all!</p>
